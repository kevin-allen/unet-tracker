# Tracking project example

To learn how to use unetTracker, you can start with a project example in which you train a network to track moving objects in a video.

In this example project, the code will run in Google Colab using Google's GPUs. You will need access to a Google Drive.

1. Find a video file with moving target objects. Ideally, the video resolution should be approximately 480x680 or smaller. You can use [online tools](https://online-video-cutter.com/resize-video) to change the resolution of your video. The mp4 format is supported. You can download an example video file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ezrMsINCKPN85O4H71IKKd5cD8u4CE2M/view?usp=drive_link

2. Make sure that you can run a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab and access your Google Drive. You can follow the instructions from the [Data Science course](https://github.com/kevin-allen/dataScienceNeuro/blob/main/colab.md).

3. If not already done, create a folder called `dsfolder` at the root of your Google Drive.
   
4. Copy the content of the folder `unetTracker/tracking_project_notebooks_colab` to a folder called `dsfolder` on your Google Drive.
  
5. Follow the instructions in the Notebooks located in `dsfolder` on your Google Drive. The notebooks have numbers in their names (00, 01, 02, etc.). Read them and run the code in numerical order. All the Notebooks should run in Google Colab.
