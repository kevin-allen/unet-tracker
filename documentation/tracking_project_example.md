# Tracking project example

To learn how to use unetTracker, you can start with a project example in which you can train a network to track fingers in a video.

1. Find a video file with moving target objects. Ideally, the video resolution should be 480x680 or smaller. You can download an example video file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ezrMsINCKPN85O4H71IKKd5cD8u4CE2M/view?usp=drive_link
2. [Install unetTracker Python package in your Python environment](https://github.com/kevin-allen/unetTracker/blob/main/documentation/install.md). 
3. Follow the instructions in the notebooks located in the folder `tracking_project_example_notebooks`. The notebooks have numbers in their names (00, 01, 02, etc.). Read them and run the code in numerical order.
