## Installation


### NVIDIA GPU and drivers

You will need to have a GPU and GPU drivers loaded in order to use the GPU to train your network.

You can get instructions from [NVIDIA](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html) to do this.


### Create your virtual environment

If you have a conda environment already activated, do `conda deactivate` and make sure you are not in a virtual environment.

Create a virtual environment using venv and install the required packages.

Here the virtual environment will be called `torch`.

```
cd ~
sudo apt-get install pip
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
python3 -m venv torch
source torch/bin/activate
```

If this stalls, check that your proxy is set properly. For instance at the DKFZ, you would use this code.

```
echo $https_proxy
export https_proxy=www-int2.inet.dkfz-heidelberg.de:80
```

Make sure your `torch` environment is activated for all the remaining installation steps.

To activate the `torch` environment...
```
cd 
source torch/bin/activate
```

### Clone the unet-tracker repository

```
mkdir ~/repo
cd ~/repo
git clone https://github.com/kevin-allen/unetTracker.git
```

### Install the unet-tracker package

```
cd unetTracker
pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Testing your installation

You should now be able to import unet-tracker and torch from Python.

In a terminal, get a python terminal
```
ipython
```

Within python...

```
import torch
import unetTracker
```

Check if a Cuda device (GPU) is available.

```
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

If you have a Cuda-supported GPU installed correctly, this should return True.


### PyTorch for Jetson

If you are using a Nvidia Jetson instead of a Linux PC, you probably want to install Pytorch as indicated on the [Nvidia website](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson/72048)


### Run jupyter lab


You will need to run `source torch/bin/activate` each time you open a terminal to activate your virtual environment. 

You can decide to activate it by default by putting `source torch/bin/activate` at the end of your `bash.rc` file.

Start jupyter lab and get going with the notebooks in the unet-tracker repository.

If you are working on a desktop machine, just run this command to start the jupyter lab server.

```
jupyter lab
```


### Run jupyter lab on a remote server

If you are working on a remote server, run this on the server

```
jupyter lab --no-browser
```

On your local machine, run

```
ssh -N -L 8889:localhost:8889 kevin@a230-pc89
```

Then paste the address of the jupyter server into your browser. It should look like `http://localhost:8889/lab?token=d0427240ec80edfab108b8a0e69a3d8sdfasdfasdfasdfa6`


You will have to make sure that the jupyter lab extensions are enable (click on the icon that looks like a puzzel piece called extension manager, far left of the jupyter lab window).
