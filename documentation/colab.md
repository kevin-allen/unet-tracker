# Running unetTracker on Google Colab

Google Colab is a good option for training neural networks if you don't have access to a local GPU. This usually simplifies the installation since we all use equivalent computers when using Google Colab.  

There is a series of Notebooks in the folder `tracking_project_notebooks_colab` that you can use to use unetTracker on Google Colab. 

The main disadvantage of using Google Colab is that the GUI is less responsive than running notebooks on a desktop computer with a decent NVIDIA GPU.

You can use these [instructions](https://github.com/kevin-allen/dataScienceNeuro/blob/main/colab.md) to start with Google Colab and learn how to mount your Google Drive from Google Colab.

I would recommend copying the content of the folder `tracking_project_notebooks_colab` to a directory on your Google Drive. Then, you can double-click on the first notebook to get going with your unetTracker project.
