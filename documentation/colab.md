# Running unetTracker on Google Colab

Google Colab is a good option for training neural networks if you don't have access to a local GPU. This usually simplifies the installation, since we are all using equivalent computers when using Google Colab.  

There is a series of Notebooks in the folder `tracking_project_notebooks_colab` that you can use to use unetTracker on Google Colab. 

The main disadvantage of using Google Colab is that the GUI is not as responsive as if you run notebooks on a desktop computer with a decent NVIDIA GPU.
